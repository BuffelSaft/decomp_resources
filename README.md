# decomp_resources

This repository contains data files needed to expand the Pokedex in pokeemerald. These files have been dumped directly from Ultra Sun 
using a modified pk3DS, 
and include data for every Pokemon and form in the game.


**Currently included files are:**


- Level up moves
- Egg moves
- Base stats
- Pokedex entries


**Files that will be added in future are:**


- TM, HM and Tutor compatibility
- High quality cries
