This repository contains data files needed to expand the Pokedex in pokeemerald. Most of these files have been dumped directly from Ultra Sun 
using a modified pk3DS, 
and include data for every Pokemon and form in the game. Please see this thread for more details: https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?p=9978471#post9978471


**Currently included files are:**


- Level up moves
- Egg moves
- Base stats
- Pokedex entries
- Species names
- High quality cries


**Files that will be added in future are:**


- TM, HM and Tutor compatibility
- More cries
